  type Element a

  -- | 'converge' is a function that returns the value the stream is converging
  -- to. If given a stream which doesn't converge to a single value then
  -- 'converge' will not terminate.
  --
  -- If the stream is empty then it should return nothing.
  --
  -- >>> let initialGuess = 1 :: Double
  -- >>> let improve x = (x + 121 / x) / 2
  -- >>> converge (iterate improve initialGuess)
  -- Just 11.0
  --
  -- >>> converge [] :: Maybe [Int]
  -- Nothing
  converge :: a -> Maybe (Element a)

  -- | 'convergeErr' is a function that returns the value the stream is
  -- converging to. It also takes a function err which returns a value which
  -- varies monotonically with the error of the value in the stream. This can
  -- be used to ensure that when 'convergeErr' terminates when given a
  -- non-converging stream or a stream which enters a cycle close to the
  -- solution. See the documentation for the CReal instance for a caveat with
  -- that implementation.
  --
  -- It's often the case that streams generated with approximation
  -- functions such as Newton's method will generate worse approximations for
  -- some number of steps until they find the "zone of convergence". For these
  -- cases it's necessary to drop some values of the stream before handing it
  -- to convergeErr.
  --
  -- For example trying to find the root of the following funciton @f@ with a
  -- poor choice of starting point. Although this doesn't find the root, it
  -- doesn't fail to terminate.
  --
  -- >>> let f  x = x ^ 3 - 2 * x + 2
  -- >>> let f' x = 3 * x ^ 2 - 2
  -- >>> let initialGuess = 0.1 :: Float
  -- >>> let improve x = x - f x / f' x
  -- >>> let err x = abs (f x)
  -- >>> convergeErr err (iterate improve initialGuess)
  -- Just 1.0142132

-- | The overlapping instance for @'CReal' n@ has a slightly different
-- behavior. The instance for 'Eq' will cause 'converge' to return a value when
-- the list converges to within 2^-n (due to the 'Eq' instance for @'CReal' n@)
-- despite the precision the value is requested at by the surrounding
-- computation. This instance will return a value approximated to the correct
-- precision.
--
-- It's important to note when the error function reaches zero this function
-- behaves like 'converge' as it's not possible to determine the precision at
-- which the error function should be evaluated at.
